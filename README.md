# youtube_downloader
youtube downloader is a window-based application, which I made using Tkinter, Pytube library in Python. 

It downloads the video/audio from the youtube.

STEPS TO DOWNLOAD - 
1. User has to input the link to the video (from youtube).
2. Select the download path.
3. Select the quality (low/high), or for only audio (only audio).

There is also the setup file, which u can simply download and run on your system.
